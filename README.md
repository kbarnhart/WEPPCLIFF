# WEPPCLIFF
An R-based command line tool designed to prepare climate inputs for WEPP, which has been extended to perform other general functions such as quality checking, gap filling, and erosion index calculations (climate inputs for USLE family models).

# CURRENT VERSION
Version 1.4 is the most recent upload to this repository. Version 1.4 focused on improvements to basic trimming operations, quality checking, and data export. Version 1.5 will focus on ways to improve the gap filling model. The current model works well for most aspects of the climate, but there is room for improvement. The current wish list includes adding rates of change and more storm characteristics to the gap filling model.

# INSTALL FILES
Zip files (corresponding to software version) contain code, documentation, and example files needed for a new installation on Windows or OSX. Linux installation is also possible (and should be relatively simple), but no support is provided in the documentation.

# RUN TUTORIALS
In order to run the AutoTutorial on a Mac, change the directory in AutoTutorial.sh to where you have WEPPCLIFF.R unzipped on your machine. Then type: "bash path_to_AutoTutorial_here/AutoTutorial.sh" in your terminal. In order to run on Windows, make sure that the directory structure matches that in the Tutorial.txt file or change the paths in AutoTutorial.bat to where you have installed Rscript.exe and WEPPCLIFF.R. Then double-click on AutoTutorial.bat.
