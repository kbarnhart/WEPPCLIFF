# WEPPCLIFF
An R-based command line tool designed to prepare climate inputs for WEPP, which has been extended to perform other general functions such as quality checking, gap filling, and erosion index calculations (climate inputs for USLE family models).

# CURRENT VERSION
Version 1.3.1 is the most recent upload to this repository. Version 1.3 focused on improvements to the precipitation gap-detection and general gap-filling model. Version 1.4 (unreleased) is focusing on improvements when using small amounts of data (i.e. single storm analysis, corner cases with continous data for a single year, more precise trimming mechanisms, etc).

# INSTALL FILES
Zip files (corresponding to software version) contain code, documentation, and example files needed for a new installation on Windows or OSX. Linux installation is also possible (and should be relatively simple), but no support is provided in the documentation.

# CONTRIBUTIONS
Contributions are welcomed. Any contributions that materially improve performance, capabilities, accuracy, compatibility, etc. will be given appropriate credit and ownership. All contributions that are to be distributed as "WEPPCLIFF" must be approved by the original copyright holder, Ryan P. McGehee.
