# WEPPCLIFF
An R-based command line tool designed to prepare climate inputs for WEPP, which has been extended to perform other general functions such as quality checking, gap filling, and erosion index calculations (climate inputs for USLE family models).

# How to Install
Clone this repository to your own preferred location (for Windows machines, it is recommended to do this directly to the C:/ drive). Make sure you install R version 3.6.1 or later (WEPPCLIFF was most recently validated with R-3.6.1). Open the Tutorial.txt file (and WEPPCLIFF Documentation.pdf if one wants more information) and follow the instructions within. Otherwise, follow instructions below for automated tutorials.

# Run Automated Tutorial on UNIX
Open Terminal and type the following: bash path_to_AutoTutorial_here/AutoTutorial.sh

# Run Automated Tutorial on Windows
Open Command Prompt and type the following: path_to_AutoTutorial_here/AutoTutorial.bat

# Current Version
Version 1.4 is the most recent upload to this repository. Version 1.4 focused on improvements to basic trimming operations, quality checking, and data export. Future versions are attempting to focus on ways to improve the gap filling model. The current model works well for most aspects of the climate outputs, but there is room for improvement. The current wish list includes adding rates of change and more storm characteristics to the gap filling model.

# Contributions
Contributions are always warmly welcomed. Any contributions that materially improve performance, capabilities, accuracy, compatibility, etc. will be gladly incorporated in the source code, credited, and distributed through this repository.
